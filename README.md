# A-Voting

It is a completely decentralized e-voting system using ethereum blockchain. 

## Abstract 
This project aims at implementing a voting system based on Ethereum's Blockchain. It is a 
system made in the form of application used for Electronic Voting. This is done to solve the 
current problem on conventional electronic voting system where the integrity of the data can't 
be ascertain and the result of the vote can be tampered malicious actors. To solve this problem, 
an electronic voting system will be built that store the data of election results on blockchain to 
ensure the integrity of the data. It is a secure, transparent and decentralized way of voting.
